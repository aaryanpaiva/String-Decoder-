# String-Decoder-

Overview:
The "Decode" Java program is a simple console-based application that takes a keyword, 
removes spaces and duplicates from it, and then uses this keyword to decode a provided sentence.
The program is designed to illustrate the process of encoding and decoding text based on a user-provided keyword.

Prerequisites:
Before running the program, you need to have the following prerequisites:

Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
A Java code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) for running and testing the program.

How to Run the Program:
Follow these steps to run the "Decode" Java program:

    1. Open your preferred Java code editor or IDE.
    2. Create a new Java project or file.
    3. Copy and paste the Java code provided in the decode.java file into your project or file.
    4. Save the project or file with an appropriate name, such as "DecodeProgram."
    5. Compile and run the program.
    6. The program will prompt you to enter a keyword and a sentence. Follow the on-screen instructions
        and provide the requested input.
    8. The program will remove spaces and duplicates from the keyword, encode it, and then use the encoded keyword to decode the provided sentence.
    9. The decoded text will be displayed as the program's output.

Program Logic:
The program follows these main steps:

    1. Accepts user input for a keyword and a sentence, both in uppercase.
    2. Removes spaces and duplicate characters from the keyword.
    3. Creates an alphabet array to represent the characters from 'A' to 'Z.'
    4. Encodes the keyword by mapping characters from the keyword to characters from the alphabet array.
    5. Decodes the sentence based on the encoded keyword and displays the decoded text.
