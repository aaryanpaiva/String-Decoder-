Algorithm for the "decode" Java Program:

    1. Import necessary Java utilities.

    2. Define a class named decode.

    3. In the main method, accept user input for a keyword and a sentence, both in uppercase.

    4. Remove spaces and duplicate characters from the keyword using the spaRep method.

    5. Create an array alpha to represent the alphabet from 'A' to 'Z'.

    6. Initialize an array enc to store the encoded keyword. Copy characters from the keyword to enc.

    7. Fill the remaining elements in the enc array with characters not present in the keyword.
       This step ensures that all letters of the alphabet are accounted for in the encoding.

    8. Initialize an empty string out to store the decoded text.

    9. Loop through each character in the input sentence.

    10. For each character in the sentence, find its corresponding character in the enc array and append the corresponding character from the alpha array to the out string.

    11. If the character is a space, add a space to the out string to maintain spacing.

    12. Display the decoded text to the user as the program's output.

    13. Define a static method spaRep to remove spaces and duplicate characters from a string.

    14. In the spaRep method, initialize a modified string abc.

    15. Loop through each character in the input string.

    16. If a character is a space, skip it; otherwise, add the non-space character to the abc string.

    17. After processing the input string, create a new string xyz to remove duplicate characters.

    18. Loop through the characters in the modified abc string.

    19. If a character is not already present in the xyz string, add it to xyz to remove duplicates.

    20. Return the modified xyz string without spaces and duplicate characters.
